# Highline

## About

Best of Ruby Quiz, Chapter 7

...start a module called HighLine (for high-level, line- oriented interface). Ideally this module would eventually cover many aspects of terminal interaction, but for this quiz weâ€™ll focus just on getting input.

```ruby
age = ask("What is your age?", Integer, :within => 0..105)

num = eval "0b#{ ask(' Enter a binary number.', String, :validate => /^[01_]+$/ ) }"

if ask_if("Would you like to continue?") # ...
```

None of these ideas is etched in stone. Feel free to call your input method prompt( ) or use a set of classes. Rework the interface any way you like.

The goal is to provide an easy-to-use yet robust method of requesting input. It should free the programmer of common concerns like calls to chomp( ) and ensuring valid input.

## Requirements

Ruby 2.2.2

## Notes

## Usage

run `bundle install`
`require 'highline'`

**1. include**

In any class, the Highline module can be included with `include Highline`. Then, call the methods directly, e.g. `ask(question, klass, within:)`

**2. without include**

Methods can be called directly with `Highline.ask(question, klass, within:)`. 

**#ask(question, klass, within: nil, validate: nil)**

`within:` should be a Range and validate should be a regular expression. 

**#ask_if(question)**

Returns true or false.

## Understanding the Question

- if the argument is not within range, raise an error and try again.

## Results

```shell
What is your age?
> 1005
1005 is not within 0..105. Try again.
What is your age?
> 015
#age Answer: 13
Enter a  binary number.
> 01xabc
01xabc does not match (?-mix:^[01_]+$). Try again.
Enter a  binary number.
> 010101_111
#num Answer: 175
Would you like to continue? (y or n)
> a
Please enter y or n.. Try again.
Would you like to continue? (y or n)
> b
Please enter y or n.. Try again.
Would you like to continue? (y or n)
> c
Please enter y or n.. Try again.
Would you like to continue? (y or n)
> y
you did continue.
```
